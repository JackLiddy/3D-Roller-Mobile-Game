TODO

determine if mobile or not  
    button at start
        (mobile) - use the devices gyroscope
        (desktop) - use the keyboard

request gyroscope access
    - confirm IOS and android
    - if error
        access denied - access was denied to gyrpscope: reload page, clear cookies, ect
        gyroscope not supported - error message
        check if your device supports gyroscope
      
keyboard controls
    get keyboard input
    adjust orientation on input

gyroscope controls
    sync gyroscop to orientation change


implement realistic rolling
    sync position change with  object rotation

gameplay mechanic ideas
    - roll into pits, falling into next level
    - avoid obstacles generated
    - constantly roll downhill, avoiding obstacles

research gravity implementation
    - manually lower position
    - implement gravity engine with three.js

graphics improvements
    - render background
    - add lighting
    - add textures




gyroscope
X-axis
Y-axis
Z-axis


flat on table
    X 0
    Y 0
    Z -9

rotate left
    X 0 to -9
rotate right
    X 0 to 9

rotate forward
    Y 0 to 9
rotate backwards
    Y 0 to -9



Completed
    new movement paragi


To Do
    Configure mobile orientation controls
    Fix shadow plane, expand region
    Use code that slices in plane or add new plane
    Add obstacles


mobile module  
    change so phone tilt doesnt set the speed but increases the speed by a amount based on the tilt
    allows for incremental increase of speed by holding the tilt 
    have it capped at a top speed
